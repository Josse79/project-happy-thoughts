# Happy Thoughts

An app to list latest 20 posts with API and post new ones with POST method. 
Additionally be able to count and update likes via other API endpoint and object id.

## The problem

First planning which components to create - then trying to get all the data. When stucked I viewed the code along lessions, looked into SO, other people codes and googled. Had trouble getting the likes to increase, but after creating the Api component, I did get it to work out.
